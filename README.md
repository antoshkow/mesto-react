# Mesto

## Project work 3.
## *This work is a raw version, most of the bugs are fixed in the [linked](https://github.com/antoshkow/react-mesto-auth/ "Link to the repo.") repository!*

1. Project work "Mesto" (sprint 10-11).

2. An interactive page where you can add photos, delete them, put likes. The logic is written in JavaScript (appearance of pop-up windows, form validation, adding cards, etc.). In the *5th sprint* we implemented opening/closing and pop-up functionality for adding elements, removing them, as well as pop-up with a lightbox image. In *6th sprint* we developed form validation and improved UX when working with pop-ups. *Sprint 7* - code refactoring, getting started with OOP and modules (added Card and FormValidator classes). *8 sprint* - code rewritten in accordance with OOP, modular code built using Webpack. *9 sprint* - the site is connected to api. Improved ux/ui components.
This work is a port of the project on React JS (with all functionality except validation) (*10-11 sprints*).
